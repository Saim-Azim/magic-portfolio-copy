## Overview  

This project focuses on building a scalable school management platform for both web and mobile, enabling parents, teachers, and administrators to manage child profiles, scheduling, and real-time updates efficiently.  

## Key Features  

- **Architected a school management portal** with React.js, React Router, Redux Toolkit, and Axios, supporting dynamic child profiles and internationalized school data.  
- **Built a responsive back-to-school questionnaire system** using React hooks, Redux Thunk, and Tailwind CSS, reducing parent onboarding time by 40%.  
- **Implemented dynamic theming** (dark/light/high-contrast) with Context API and Web Animations API, improving accessibility and user satisfaction.  
- **Integrated secure authentication** with JWT session management and Google OAuth, while adding error boundaries and React Query caching to improve session reliability.  
- **Optimized real-time synchronization** using WebSockets and Geolocation API, ensuring scalability, with unit tests in Jest and React Testing Library to maintain reliability.  
- **Enhanced front-end performance** by applying tree shaking, code splitting, and lazy loading, improving overall app responsiveness by 20%.  

## Technologies Used  

- **React.js, Redux Toolkit, React Router**  
- **Tailwind CSS, Context API, React Query**  
- **Node.js, JWT, Google OAuth**  
- **WebSockets, Geolocation API**  
- **Jest & React Testing Library**  

## Outcome  

The PikMyKid Web & Web App streamlined school operations, improved parent onboarding, enhanced accessibility, and ensured secure, real-time communication between parents and schools. Performance and reliability improvements led to higher adoption rates and better scalability.

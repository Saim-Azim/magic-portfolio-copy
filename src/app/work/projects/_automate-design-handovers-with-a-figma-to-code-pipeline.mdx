## Overview

Developed a comprehensive scheduling, alerts, and business analytics platform for PetCheck Technology, integrating advanced UI/UX features with optimized performance to improve operational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Scheduling System**: Customized and integrated **React-big-calendar** with React.js, enabling event creation, modification, and management — improving scheduling efficiency by 30%.  
- **Real-Time Alerts & Notifications**: Built a live alerts module using **Redux, async APIs, and WebSockets**, providing instant alerts with read/unread tracking to boost user engagement.  
- **Business Dashboard with RBAC**: Designed a data-driven business dashboard with **role-based access control**, integrating revenue metrics, peak-hour analysis, and customer insights via Redux Toolkit and REST APIs — reducing data retrieval time by 40%.  
- **Automated Payroll Reporting**: Automated payroll workflows with **API-driven report generation, scheduled tasks, and SMTP notifications**, cutting manual errors by 25% and accelerating delivery.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced React rendering by applying **memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting**, reducing page load time by 22%.  

## Technologies Used

- **React.js + Redux Toolkit**: For state management, scheduling, and dashboard features.  
- **React-big-calendar**: For advanced scheduling UI.  
- **WebSockets & REST APIs**: For real-time alerts and data retrieval.  
- **SMTP & Scheduled Tasks**: For payroll automation and notifications.  
- **JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3**: For building optimized, responsive UI.  

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was handling **real-time data synchronization** across scheduling and alerts without performance bottlenecks. This was solved by optimizing WebSocket connections, batching API calls, and leveraging memoization in React. Implementing RBAC securely was another key learning, ensuring smooth user-specific access to dashboards and reports.

## Outcome

The PetCheck Technology platform significantly improved operational efficiency:  
- Scheduling efficiency increased by **30%**.  
- Data retrieval time reduced by **40%**.  
- Manual payroll errors dropped by **25%**.  
- Page load speed improved by **22%**.  

This project successfully streamlined PetCheck’s workflows and enhanced user engagement, making it a reliable and scalable platform.
